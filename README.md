I'm Salma, a research engineer and I like machine learning, systems and compilers. I'm an equestrian and a proud advocate for embracing the whimsical charm of a crazy cat lady life.

Previously, I worked at [Microsoft](https://apps.microsoft.com/home), focusing on leveraging GPT-enriched metadata for Store catalog categorization. I've led projects in data and perception engineering at several AI-first startups, with a focus on healthcare, autonomous agrobotics, and developer tooling. I'm fond of applied research and have researched deep learning for cell segmentation at Carnegie Mellon, privacy-preserving data sharing at [OpenMined](https://openmined.org/), and modelled contact tracing solutions using GNNs for pandemic global health initiatives at [PathCheck](https://www.pathcheck.org/).
